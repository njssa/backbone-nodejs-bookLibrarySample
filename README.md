# backbone-nodejs-bookLibrarySample

A sample of a library application for managing books using Backbone.js, Node.js and MongoDB. 

**Prerequisites**

You need to install all of the following prerequisites:

* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).

**Installation**

```bash

git clone https://github.com/njssa/backbone-nodejs-bookLibrarySample.git

cd backbone-nodejs-bookLibrarySample

# nodemon - helps develop node.js applications by automatically
# restarting the node application when file changes are detected
npm install -g nodemon 

nodemon server.js # to run app

```

Your application should run on port 4000, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
